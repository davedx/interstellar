      <p class="sarabun-regular">
        A system for interstellar transport to nearby stars is proposed
        utilizing current theoretically possible technology and engineering.
        It consists of two primary components: a fixed launch system used
        to accelerate spacecraft to relativistic speeds for interstellar
        transport, and an anti-matter beam core rocket capable of deccelerating
        to a stop at the destination.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-xl sarabun-medium my-4">Launch and Production Platform</h3>

    <p class="my-1">
      The Launch and Production Platform (LPP) is a circular superstructure
      8000km in diameter.
    </p>

    <p class="my-1">It is located at the Sun-Venus L4 Lagrange Point.</p>
    <p class="my-1">The LPP has two primary functions:</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg sarabun-medium my-3">Launch</h4>
    <p class="my-1">
      The launch system is an electromagnetically inducted slingshot device,
      with the following properties:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>
        In acceleration mode, it is a closed loop. Objects are accelerated to
        relativistic speeds inside, completing many cycles before reaching their
        terminal velocity
      </li>
      <li>
        In release mode, the launch hatch is opened, and the object inside is
        released on its outbound trajectory
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="my-4">Arbitrary launch velocities are supported by this design.
      This paper considers 0.5c as its base launch velocity.</p>
    <h3 class="text-lg sarabun-medium my-3">Production</h3>
    <p class="my-1">
      100km circumference proton particle accelerators are located along the
      interior rim of the superstructure at regular intervals. Anti-hydrogen is
      produced in the particle accelerators from positrons and anti-protons.
      There are 500 accelerators, each feeding into independent magnetic
      confinement storage systems.
    </p>
    <p class="my-1">
      Assuming an anti-matter conversion efficiency within the accelerators of
      0.0001, the system can produce:</p>
    <div class="my-4 mx-8 text-xl">
      9 x 10<sup>4</sup>g (90 kg) per year of
      anti-matter
    </div>
    <h3 class="text-lg sarabun-medium my-3">Notes</h3>
    <p class="my-1">
      The limiting factor on the LPP's minimum size is the acceptable radial
      acceleration imposed on the human passengers of a spacecraft accelerated
      to relativistic speeds. As the acceleration period is long, this is set to
      a maximum of 1.5g, implying a minimum radius at a maximum velocity of
      0.95c equal to ~4000km.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      The limiting factor on a spacecraft's mass is the amount of anti-matter
      that can usefully be produced in the pre-launch period.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Why not use an anti-matter rocket to accelerate too? The answer is because
      if we cannot escape the <a class="underline" href="https://www.kallmorris.com/columns/tyranny-of-the-rocket-equation">
        tyranny of the rocket equation</a>, we can at least cut it in half. Future
        missions to construct a decceleration superstructure at other star systems
        could be interesting.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      The LPP is powered from an array of solar panels tethered to the outer
      cirumference the superstructure. There are 5.03 x 10<sup>12</sup>m<sup
        >2</sup
      >
      of solar panels. At a panel efficiency of 0.2, and a solar irradiance of
      2622 W/m<sup>2</sup>, this provides a nameplate capacity not including
      system losses of 2.6<sup>6</sup> GW.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      The LPP structure is not a continuous rigid body, but consists of many
      thousands of modules tethered to each other with cables. The LPP rotates,
      providing structural tension and stability, at 7 revolutions per day,
      imparting a centrifugal acceleration of 1m/s<sup>2</sup> at the outer edge
      of the structure.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      The LPP has no station keeping thrusters to maintain its orbit within the
      L4 Lagrange point. This results in a drift away from the sun of
      approximately 20km/year with its currently designed mass and structure.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl sarabun-medium my-4">Spacecraft Candidates</h2>

    <h3 class="text-lg sarabun-medium my-3">Interstellar probe</h3>
    <p class="my-1">
      In order to facilitate a long-range interstellar probe, a spacecraft with
      a total mass including fuel of 100kg (50kg anti-matter propellent) is
      proposed. The probe would be accelerated to 0.5c by the slingshot. It
      would deccelerate at approximately 1.5 x 10<sup>4</sup>m/s<sup>2</sup>
      using its anti-matter rocket. This would result in a total mission
      duration to Alpha Centauri of around 10 years, with a pre-launch fuel
      production phase of 1 year.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg sarabun-medium my-3">Interstellar settlement fleet</h3>
    <p class="my-1">
      It is more practicable for most kinds of settlement missions to be split
      into phases. For settlement of a planet in a different star system, a
      fleet of several spacecraft is proposed.
    </p>

    <ol class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>
        Survey and power: the first spacecraft contains autonomous planetary
        probes (topographic, geological, biological, water and weather;
        communications), with seed manufacturing equipment for in-situ solar PV
        production. Cell and panel production begins as soon as a suitable site
        is located by the probes and the manufacturing equipment is landed.<br />
        Mass: 5,000kg (2,500kg propellent).
      </li>
      <li>
        Manufacturing, power and habitat construction: the next three spacecraft
        (for redundancy and multiple landing sites) contain equipment for
        bootstrapping an industrial base, power generation and distribution, and
        habitat construction.<br />
        Mass: 5,000kg each.
      </li>
      <li>
        Human transport: subsequent spacecraft transport humans alongside their
        consumable supplies such as food and other necessary materials, and
        higher technology components, that are not expected to be found on a
        distant planet or easily manufactured in-situ.<br />
        Mass: 5,000kg each.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="my-1">
      Anti-matter rockets with 2,500kg of propellent require 1,250kg of
      anti-matter, which can be produced in 14 years by the particle accelerator
      system. Travel time to a star 5 light years away at 0.5c is approximately
      11 years (decceleration at 1g takes ~170 days).
    </p>
    <p class="my-1">
      Travelling mostly at 0.5c, the humans experience a subjective time of
      approximately 9.5 years due to time dilation (Lorentz factor of 1.15). It
      is possible to change the parameters of the human transport mission to
      allow a higher relativistic velocity, thereby increasing the Lorentz
      factor and subjective time. This would extend the total mission time in
      order to produce the extra necessary anti-matter.
    </p>
    <p class="my-1">
      Given an interstellar settlement mission with 5 human transports, the
      total mission time for the whole fleet to reach its destination is:

    <h2 class="text-xl sarabun-medium mt-6 mb-4">Manufacturing and Construction</h2>

    <h3 class="text-lg sarabun-medium my-3">Key technologies</h3>

    <p class="my-1">
      Manufacturing of the superstructure is a significant engineering and logistics
      undertaking. Most of the technology necessary is already at a high readiness
      level today, for example particle accelerators, solar PV, various
      electromagnetic induction and rail-based motive systems (for example maglev
      trains). However, some technologies are not commercialized, under-developed,
      or under-researched. For this project to be possible, the following
      technologies require more research and development:
    </p>

    <ol class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li><b>Anti-matter storage and distribution (magnetic confinement).</b><br/>
      While anti-matter has been successfully stored in confinement in laboratory
      conditions, it has only been extremely small amounts. Capture, long term storage
      and distribution from storage to spacecraft propellant tanks is one of the highest
      risk projects of the transport system.</li>
      
      <li><b>Superstructure module manufacturing and construction.</b><br/>
      This could be subdivided into constituent components, but it is sufficient to
      note that the ability of humanity to construct such a large structure is
      contingent on an extremely high degree of autonomous extraction, manufacturing,
      and construction. This means a diversified robotic fleet capable of operating
      in the extremely hostile environment of space with almost no human intervention
      over extremely long periods.</li>

      <li><b>Self-replicating robots.</b><br/>
      A dependency of the above is that the fleet of robots must be able to both repair
      itself <b>and self-replicate</b>. Without this key capability, the timelines for
      manufacturing the superstructure would be prohibitive given the limited launch
      capabilities of Earth to space, even with reusable rockets.</li>

      <li><b>Anti-matter (beamed core) rocketry.</b><br/>
      Critical to the entire concept of this transport system is that spacecraft
      launched at relativistic velocities must be able to deccelerate again. Very few
      propulsion methods known to be physically possible meet these requirements.
      Interstellar transport excludes almost all known propulsion except nuclear based
      systems: nuclear pulsed propulsion and anti-matter rocket variants. Anti-matter
      rockets have several challenges that are extremely difficult to solve (TRL 1),
      for example controlling the direction of thrust using some form of magnetic
      confinement, and ensuring annihilation is continuous and controlled the entire
      duration of the rocket's operation (almost half a year at 1g).</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="my-1">Many other new technologies and engineering methods will need to
      be researched, manifested and scaled up in order to build the superstructure,
      but the three listed are the most critical. Without significant progress, our
      current industrial and technological base will never let us reach the stars.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg sarabun-medium my-3">Timelines</h3>

    <p class="my-1">Self-replicating robots are the key enabler of the construction of
      the superstructure. A robotic fleet is considered whereby each robot can replicate
      itself once per month. Each robot has a mass of 100kg, and can construct
      superstructure components at a base construction rate of 100kg/day.
    </p>
    <p class="my-1">Given the exponential growth of the robotic fleet, this results
      in a time to completion of the superstructure of:
